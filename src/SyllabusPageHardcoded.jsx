        <p>
          ESE3600 Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is an exciting field at the intersection of embedded machine learning (ML) applications, algorithms, hardware, and software. TinyML differs from mainstream machine learning (e.g., server and cloud) in that it requires not only software expertise, but also embedded-hardware expertise. 
        </p>
        <p className="indent-8">
          This course emphasizes hands-on experience with ML training and deployment in tiny microcontroller-based devices. The course features application-based projects on a TinyML program kit that includes an Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller with onboard sensors, a camera, and a breadboard with wires—enough to unlock capabilities such as image, sound, and gesture detection. Before you know it, you’ll be implementing an entire TinyML application. 
        </p>
        <p className="indent-8">
          The course will also feature real-world application case studies and a creative project that will help you examine the challenges facing real-world TinyML deployments.

        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Lectures</h4>
        <p>
          Lectures will be held in AGH 104. Regular attendance is mandatory as we will have hands-on tutorials in each session. We will have the lecture session in the first 60 minutes to cover concepts. This is followed by <Link href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</Link> coding tutorials for the following 30 minutes. Lectures will be recorded and posted on Canvas so you can review them anytime after the lecture.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Tutorials</h4>
        <p>
          Throughout the semester we will have over 27 hands-on coding tutorials. These are essential for reinforcing the machine learning concepts, learning to code in Python and understanding the TensorFlow API. We will start the tutorials in the class session and also cover them in the recitation session.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Assignments</h4>
        <p>
          Assignments will challenge you to take all that you have learned and apply it to solve practical hands-on tasks. These will be done through collabs for Modules 1 and 2 and will require deploying code to the arduino microcontroller in Module 3. Please read the following list carefully.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">

        <p>The Canvas site will reference a number of online texts and research papers relevant to each week’s material. We will introduce several new concepts and have dedicated readings  so you can deep dive into the math and code.</p>
        <h4 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Software</h4>
        <p>
          This course will regularly make use of Python for both in-class examples and homework. We will use <Link href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</Link> for all assignments and projects. This will make it easy to code anywhere and anytime. Please bring your laptops to the lecture as we will have tutorials as part of each session.
        </p>
        <h4 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Project</h4>
        <p>
          At the end of the semester, students will do a project with a mobile robot. These projects are intended to take the material taught in the course and build a functioning mobile robot. Specific details on the project will be available mid-semester.

      <Card title="About TinyML" eyebrow="C">
        <p>
          TinyML is one of the fastest-growing areas of Deep Learning. In a nutshell, it’s an emerging field of <Link href="https://petewarden.com/2018/06/11/why-the-future-of-machine-learning-is-tiny/">study</Link> that explores the types of models you can run on small, low-power devices like <Link href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/11/how-to-get-started-with-machine.html">microcontrollers.</Link> 
        </p>
        <p className="indent-8">
          TinyML sits at the intersection of embedded-ML applications, algorithms, hardware and software. The goal is to enable low-latency inference at edge devices on devices that typically consume only a few <b> milliwatts </b> of battery power. By comparison, a desktop CPU would consume about 100 watts (thousands of times more!). Such a reduced power draw enables TinyML devices to operate unplugged on batteries and endure for weeks, months and possibly even years --- all while running always-on ML applications at the edge/endpoint.

          Although most of us are new to TinyML, it may surprise you to learn that TinyML has served in production ML systems for years. You may have already experienced the benefits of TinyML when you say “OK Google” to wake up an Android device. That’s powered by an always-on, low-power keyword spotter, not dissimilar in principle from the one you can learn to build <Link href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2019/11/how-to-get-started-with-machine.html">here.</Link> 
        </p>
        <p className="indent-8">
          TinyML unlocks many applications for embedded ML developers, especially when combined with sensors like accelerometers, microphones, and cameras. It is already proving useful in areas such as wildlife tracking for conservation and detecting crop diseases for agricultural needs, as well as predicting wildfires.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-8">
          TinyML can also be fun! You can develop smart game controllers such as controlling a T-Rex dinosaur using a neural-network-based motion controller or enable a variety of other games. Using the same ML principles and technical chops, you could then imagine collecting accelerator data in a car to detect various scenarios (such as a wobbly tire) and alert the driver.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-8">
          Fun and games aside, as with any ML application--- and especially when you are working with sensor data---it’s essential to familiarize yourself with <Link href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/06/responsible-ai-with-tensorflow.html">Responsible AI</Link>. TinyML can support a variety of private ML applications because inference can take place entirely at the edge (data never needs to leave the device). In fact, many tiny devices have no internet connection at all.

        <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Wellness & Counseling</h4>
        <p>
         You are not alone. Most if not all students struggle at some point throughout their study, but there are many helpful resources available on campus. If you or someone you know is going through a tough time, we strongly encourage you to seek support. <b> Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) </b> is the counseling cen- ter for the University of Pennsylvania. CAPS offers free and confidential services to all Penn students. For more information, visit <Link href="http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/caps/">http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/caps/</Link>. Consider also reaching out to a friend, family or faculty member.
        <h4 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Academic Integrity</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
         From the Pennbook:
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Since the University is an academic community, its fundamental purpose is the pursuit of knowl- edge. Essential to the success of this educational mission is a commitment to the principles of academic integrity. Every member of the University community is responsible for upholding the highest standards of honesty at all times. Students, as members of the community, are also responsible for adhering to the principles and spirit of the following Code of Academic Integrity.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Consequences for academic dishonesty range from receiving a 0 on a homework or exam to disciplinary action.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>Any suspected cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for investigation.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignorance of the Code of Academic Integrity is not an acceptable defense. For example, using outside solutions to homework problems is not acceptable.
